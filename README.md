I couldn't find anything that very clearly granted permission to redistribute 
the OBSE source code... so I'm not. This source code distribution contains MY 
code, and any Visual Studio project and metadata files needed to get things 
to build. As such, to get this working, you'll need to download the OBSE 
source yourself, and then fit all the files into place. Make sure that files 
from this download aren't overwritten.
